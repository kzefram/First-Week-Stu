        <p>I have been tutoring French imersion and Basic Computer Skills for four years, and I have recently took the plung into more 
            computer/IT related fields. I have studied Software Quality Assurance and currently, a Coding Bootcamp through University
            of New Brunswick. I am also moonlighting in Web Design/Simple Websites.
        </p>
        <p>I chose this field because while tutor/teaching my daughter basic computer skills, I had to learn it myself, thus, giving me
            the inspiration to continue on my own journey. As I studied the different field involved in Computer Science, I discover a 
            world that I want to partake in. That would Software Development, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer 
            Interaction, and Natural Language Processing to start. My goal is to end up doing something similar to Star Trek or at least start
            start the process.
